# Movies_EFREI
An application to help you discover new movies


This project is made by SÃ©bastien FRIEDBERG and Marc TRAVERSO for the semester 8 at EFREI PARIS. 
The goal of the application is to make a list of films that the user wants to watch, 
and to make suggestions of movies that he will probably likes by the datas that we have.
